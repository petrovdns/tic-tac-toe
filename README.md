# tic-tac-toe
Tic-tac-toe, also known as X and O or Zero Sum Game, is a simple and popular game for two players. It is played on a game board consisting of a 3x3 grid of cells. Each player is represented by a distinct symbol, usually "X" and "O".

The objective of the game is for one player to successfully complete a line, column, or diagonal with their symbol. The player who achieves this first is declared the winner.

The game begins with an empty board, and players take turns placing their symbols on the board, one at a time, until one of them completes a full line, column, or diagonal, or until all 9 cells are occupied, resulting in a draw.

Due to its simple rules and limited possibilities, tic-tac-toe is often used to teach basic concepts in programming and artificial intelligence, such as search algorithms and decision-making.
